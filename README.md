# Odin Recipes

Welcome to my Odin Fundamentals Recipes Project! This project serves as an example of applying fundamental HTML concepts to create a collection of recipes. Each recipe is presented on a separate page, allowing users to explore different culinary delights.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in HTML by creating a set of interconnected web pages. Each recipe has dedicated sections for description, ingredients, and steps, providing a clear and organized format for users to follow.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using plain HTML, emphasizing simplicity and clarity in code structure. The use of HTML ensures accessibility and ease of navigation, making it an ideal showcase of fundamental web development skills.

## Pages and Structure

- **Home Page (`index.html`):** The central hub that introduces users to the available recipes and provides links to individual recipe pages.

- **Recipe Pages (`recipe1.html`, `recipe2.html`, ...):** Each recipe has its own page, featuring sections for description, ingredients, and steps. 

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/odin-recipes.git
